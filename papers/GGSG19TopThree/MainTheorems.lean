# Implementation Theorems: Who is in Your Top Three?

This file starts the Lean audit for Garg, Gelauff, Sakshuwong, and Goel
(2019).  The first reusable surface is the large-deviation learning-rate
section: score-gap log-MGF formulas, the K-approval ternary simplification, and
the finite aggregation step from pairwise error rates to outcome error rates.

The finite Chernoff/LDP layer now includes reusable exact-rate constructors,
including a support-aware stationary-tilt method-of-types route.  The
formulas, finite aggregation, and most certificate-independent infrastructure
are paper-independent and live in `EconCSLib`.

    law hiScore loScore hCramer

/--
Exact pairwise rate from rate-parameterized periodic empirical-type witnesses
available at every strictly slower target rate.  The witness for target
`targetRate` supplies a block rate `baseRate < targetRate` and proves the full
one-period type mass is at least `exp (-Q * baseRate)`.

Exact pairwise rate from method-of-types witnesses stated in log-ratio form.
For each rounded type, the log ratio between the empirical law `q / Q` and the
source law controls the exponential part; the modal theorem supplies the
inverse-polynomial type-count loss.

/--
Exact pairwise rate from a stationary finite exponential tilt plus
rate-sensitive rounded empirical types.

The remaining choice principle `hchoose` is intentionally narrow: it only says
that after the continuity radius and desired exponential rate are known, one
can choose a denominator large enough for simplex rounding and for absorbing
the empirical-mode polynomial loss.

Exact pairwise rate from a finite law and a stationary exponential tilt.

The method-of-types lower-bound route preserves support during rounding, so no
full-support assumption is needed.  The only required positive atoms are the
positive-gap and negative-gap witnesses.

Finite-support Proposition 2 trichotomy.  Under nonnegative expected score
gap, every finite pairwise score-gap law falls into one of the finite-real
exact-rate cases already proved:

* a two-sided support case with the source Chernoff rate;
* a one-sided zero-gap boundary with exact rate `-log pZero`; or
* a strict one-sided boundary where the finite iid mistake event is eventually
  empty.

If a lower candidate has strictly larger probability of appearing in one
proper top prefix than a true winner, then the corresponding indicator prefix
score makes the canonical W-selector asymptotically wrong.  This is the
strict, non-tie converse case behind Proposition 1's ranking-law finite
algebra.

Source-shaped Proposition 1 tiered iff away from exact cross-tier prefix ties.
The forward direction is the finite tiered consistency bridge.  Conversely,
vanishing error for every reasonable prefix score implies weak top-prefix
dominance on each cumulative target prefix; the no-tie hypothesis upgrades
weak dominance to the strict source condition.

mixed expected K-approval score gap, then the finite weighted aggregate of
pairwise randomized K-approval mistakes either has an exact finite exponential

One-pair actual-law randomized-scoring comparison to a named finite bound.  The

Prefix-score specialization of `lem:randomizebetterscoring`: for a finite

Automatic source-shaped randomized-scoring static aggregate theorem over the
true W-set boundary pairs.  Proposition 1 strict dominance makes the
convex-combination static rule reasonable and asymptotically correct; the
finite-support Proposition 2 trichotomy then implies that its relevant
pairwise mistake aggregate either has an exact finite exponential rate or is
eventually zero.  This is the extended-rate-friendly branch of Theorem 1 that
does not require callers to pre-classify two-sided and one-sided supports.

Finite outcome-rate form of the Mallows W-selection no-randomization bridge.
If the same concrete pivotal pair realizes the finite outcome-learning rate
for every static K-approval rule and for the randomized rule, the pairwise
K-approval no-randomization theorem lifts directly to the finite outcome rate.

Finite outcome-rate K-approval no-randomization bridge with only static

finite outcome rate is always bounded above by the randomized boundary-pair

Actual ranking-law K-approval outcome-rate lift with a static pivotal pair.
The static component rates use the paper's K-approval up/down probabilities
for each relevant pair, while the randomized rate uses their weighted mixture.
If the supplied pivotal pair realizes every static component's finite outcome
rate and its static approval bases are positive, some static K-approval
component weakly beats the randomized finite outcome rate.
