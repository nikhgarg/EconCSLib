# Paper-Facing Theorems: Gale-Shapley 1962

This file starts the formalization of Gale and Shapley's
*College Admissions and the Stability of Marriage*.  The first closed seam is
the paper's one-to-one marriage specialization and quota-one college-admissions
wrapper: deferred acceptance produces a stable complete matching and the
proposing side receives its best partner among stable matchings.

/-! ## Paper-facing definitions -/

/--
Gale-Shapley strict marriage domain: equal-size one-to-one markets with strict
preferences and every potential pair acceptable.  The paper assumes strict
rankings and no unmatched agents in the marriage story; positivity encodes the
absence of an outside option in the reusable optional-partner API.

def gs_complete_marriage {M W : Type*} (mu : Assignment M W) : Prop :=
  (∀ m, ∃ w, mu.m_match m = some w) ∧
    (∀ w, ∃ m, mu.w_match w = some m)

/--
Applicant/proposer optimality among stable matchings: every proposer weakly
prefers this stable matching to any other stable matching.

Gale-Shapley Theorem 1, marriage form: there always exists a stable set of
marriages.  The Lean statement uses the explicit strict, complete, equal-size
source domain.

Gale-Shapley quota-one college-admissions existence wrapper.  Applicants are the
proposing side and colleges are the accepting side; quota one reduces the college
admissions story to the marriage model.

Quota-one college-admissions stability in the reusable many-to-one API.  This is
the first formal bridge toward general college quotas and hospitals/residents:
ordinary one-to-one deferred acceptance embeds as a stable quota-one
many-to-one assignment.

Gale-Shapley college-admissions existence theorem with arbitrary finite quotas.
Colleges with quota `q c` are represented by `q c` cloned seats, deferred
acceptance is run in the induced one-to-one market, and the resulting seat
assignment is collapsed back to college rosters.
