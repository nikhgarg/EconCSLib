# Finite Yao-Style Lower-Bound Lemmas

This module contains the finite expectation algebra behind Yao-style lower
bounds. It deliberately avoids modeling computational complexity: the theorem
is about finite sets of deterministic algorithms and finite input
distributions.

Finite Yao averaging lemma. If a distribution over inputs gives every
deterministic algorithm expected normalized payoff at most `bound`, then every
randomized algorithm has some input on which its expected normalized payoff is
at most `bound`.

A finite Yao certificate for randomized lower bounds.

The certificate says a hard input distribution gives every deterministic
algorithm average payoff at most `bound`.
