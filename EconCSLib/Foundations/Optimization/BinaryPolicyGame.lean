# Two-Player Binary Policy Games

Reusable normal-form bookkeeping for two players who each choose one of two
distinguished policies.

/--
Binary-policy equilibrium for two players.  Each player weakly prefers the
current policy to the other distinguished policy, holding the other player's
policy fixed.

Binary-policy equilibrium with policy-pair feasibility.  Each player must be
feasible at the current policy pair, and unilateral deviations are compared
only when the deviating pair is feasible for that player.

identified with scalar expressions, the objective comparison is the scalar
