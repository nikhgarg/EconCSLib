/--
No coordinate can be simultaneously too high above an integer anchor while
another coordinate is too low below its anchor.

This is the discrete crossing condition used in rounding arguments for
separable finite optimization problems.

/--
Two-anchor version of `NoRoundingCrossing`.

`upper` is the integer threshold above which a coordinate is too high, while
`lower` is the integer threshold below which a coordinate is too low. This is
the shape used by rounding proofs around real optima, where upper and lower
integer anchors are naturally `ceil` and `floor` bounds.
