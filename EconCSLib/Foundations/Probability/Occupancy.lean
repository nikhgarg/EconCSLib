# Occupancy Processes

Finite balls-into-bins primitives for probabilistic counting arguments.

## Main declarations

- `occupancyUsedBins`: bins hit by an assignment of balls to bins.
- `occupancyEmptyBins`: bins not hit by an assignment.
- `occupancyEmptyBins_card_eq`: exact deterministic empty-bin count.
- `occupancyEmptyBins_card_lower_bound`: at least `#bins - #balls` bins are
  empty.
- `occupancyPMF`: the uniform occupancy law over all ball-to-bin assignments.
