# Many-to-One Matching

This module contains the reusable assignment and stability API for
college-admissions and hospitals/residents style markets with capacities.

## Main declarations

- `ManyToOneAssignment`: applicants assigned to at most one college, colleges
  assigned finite rosters.
- `ManyToOneAssignment.RespectsQuota`: roster sizes are bounded by quotas.
- `ManyToOne.IsStable`: individual rationality plus no applicant-college
  blocking pair.
- `ManyToOneAssignment.ofOneToOne`: quota-one embedding of ordinary
  one-to-one assignments.
