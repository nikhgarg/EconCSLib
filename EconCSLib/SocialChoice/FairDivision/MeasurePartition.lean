# Finite Measurable Partitions as Indivisible Goods

This file packages the reusable bridge used by cake-cutting reductions: once a
measurable space has been cut into finitely many pieces, those pieces can be
treated as indivisible goods whose additive item weights are their measures.

A finite measurable partition certificate for a family of measure-valued
utilities.

The `piece_value_le` field is the condition needed by the bounded-envy
theorem after the measurable pieces are treated as indivisible goods.  The
cover/disjoint fields record the intended cake-partition semantics; the finite
allocation theorem below only needs the per-piece bound.
