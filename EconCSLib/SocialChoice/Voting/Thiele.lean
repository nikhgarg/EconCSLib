# Thiele Committee Scores

Reusable finite approval-ballot and committee-score primitives for
multi-member voting rules.

The module is intentionally score-agnostic: PAV, Thiele-squared, and other
rules should instantiate `thieleScore` with the relevant weight sequence.

the other party's last relevant seat.
