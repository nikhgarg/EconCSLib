# Voting Proportionality Lemmas

Reusable floor/ceiling arithmetic for proportional multi-member voting rules.

These lemmas are rule-agnostic: STV, Thiele/PAV, and other party-list style
proofs can first establish party lower bounds plus seat conservation, then use
this file to derive the rounded seat-share conclusion.

The complement lower bound controls the upper rounded seat count for a party.

If the other party has at least the floor of its proportional share, then the
remaining seats are at most the ceiling of this party's proportional share.

Two-party lower bounds plus total-seat conservation imply the rounded seat
share for the focal party.
