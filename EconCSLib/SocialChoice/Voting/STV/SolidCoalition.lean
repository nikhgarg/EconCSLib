# Solid-Coalition STV Process Primitives

Paper-neutral process invariants for STV proofs under solid coalitions.

The central abstraction is a separate same-party quota process. It tracks how
many same-party candidates have reached quota and how much same-party vote mass
remains. When the remaining same-party vote mass is below one quota, the process
provides the quota-witness used by two-party STV seat-share arguments.

The fractional replay layer below is deliberately phrased over the shared
`STVStep`/`STVTrace` dynamics vocabulary, with a real-valued tally oracle supplied
by the concrete transfer rule being replayed.

the terminal below-quota condition.

Concrete party-projected fractional STV election step.

The focused candidate has fractional tally at least quota; exactly one quota is
retained for the winner, and the surplus is the remaining focused tally that is
available for same-party transfer. At the party-process level this consumes one
quota of party vote mass and records one additional quota winner.

their concrete trace induces the party-quota process.

/--
Source-shaped transfer preservation step for a party projection of a shared
fractional STV trace.

This is weaker than requiring every shared trace step to be a same-party
quota-process step. If the focused candidate is in the party, quota elections
retain exactly one quota and preserve/transfer the full surplus inside the
party, while eliminations preserve the party's vote mass. If the focused
candidate is outside the party, the party state is unchanged for this projection.

Source-step law for one party projection of a concrete fractional STV step.

records the current active same-party candidate count and same-party tally
mass, and same-party focused elections meet quota. These are the facts a
concrete STV implementation or transfer-rule replay should prove step by step.

Concrete executable fractional STV step generated from an active focused
candidate. It removes the focused candidate and labels the round as an
election exactly when the current fractional tally reaches quota; otherwise it
labels the round as an elimination. Tie-breaking/focus selection is supplied by
the caller, so this definition can be reused with different deterministic
tie-breakers.

Deterministic choice rule for an executable fractional STV run.

must be active. Concrete papers instantiate this with their tie-breaking or
selection convention.

terminal active candidates are then read as the source rule's final filled

Indexed executable fractional STV trace certificate.

real-valued tally is indexed by the generated round, so it can be computed from
the recursive transfer state before being projected to any step-keyed transfer

Filled-seat STV accounting for a recursive source run.

If the source choice rule is total, the round budget is at least the current
number of active candidates, and the active set has enough candidates to fill
the remaining seats, then quota-election steps plus terminal active fills
complete exactly the seat limit. The `elected` parameter records seats filled
before this recursive suffix.

The concrete implementation content is the recursive weight fold
`fractionalSTVWeightAfterSteps`: each trace step's real-valued tally is required
to be exactly the first-active tally induced by the weights obtained by
executing all previous steps.  The remaining fields state the ordinary

No-quota elimination facts restrict from a trace to any finite prefix.

This is the routine index transport used by source-step prefix arguments: if
the full candidate-level trace has every active same-party candidate below
quota on elimination rounds, the same fact holds for `steps.take n`.

This packages the source-model facts normally produced by an executable STV
run: the global recursive transfer trace, the voter/candidate partition,
solid-coalition inputs, initial party weights, and final party residual/count
facts.  Paper-facing theorems should consume this kind of object instead of a
pre-built replay/process certificate.

Capacity preservation for a solid coalition using source-faithful lower-bound
accounting: each same-party election can remove at most one quota of the
coalition's current weight, while same-party eliminations are allowed only when
no active same-party candidate is at quota in the global tally.

Unlike the exact party-weight replay theorem, this result does not assume that
other voters give no support to same-party winners.

If the source-faithful lower-bound replay keeps the current global weight of a
solid coalition below quota, then the deterministic party-state fold is
terminal below quota. If the party has no remaining candidates, this follows
from capacity; otherwise the strengthened replay invariant bounds party-state
vote mass by the coalition's current global weight.

Prefix form of
`floor_votes_div_quota_le_finalSeats_of_executableTrace_solidCoalition_left_lowerBound_capacityTerminal`.

The executable source trace is restricted to `trace.steps.take n`; if that
prefix exhausts the party and its same-party election count is included in the
final seat count, it yields the same quota-floor lower bound.

/--
One-party executable-prefix lower-bound theorem for a prefix selected by the
`beforeActive` set of an indexed source step.

The replay endpoint is derived from the executable trace's active-set replay,
so callers only need to identify the concrete source step before which the
party has no active candidates.

An executable fractional STV trace, restricted to a solid coalition in a

The theorem is phrased for the left coalition; applying it with the voter and
