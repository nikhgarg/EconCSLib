# Candidate-Removal Reductions

Reusable primitives for RCV/STV reductions that delete candidates from the
candidate set and from every ranked ballot while preserving later active-support
counts after the deleted candidates have left the active set.

## Main declarations

- `ReducedElectionInstance.removeCandidates`
- `ReducedElectionInstance.PreservesActiveSupport`

An election instance after a candidate-removal reduction: the remaining
candidate set and the reduced ballot profile.

/--
Delete `removed` from the candidate set and from each ballot, preserving the
relative order of the remaining candidates.

The reduced profile preserves active-support counts at `active` relative to the
source ballot profile.
