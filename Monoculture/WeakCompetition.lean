First-choice-probability decomposition of Definition 3.

The gain from weaker competition is the expected value, over the weaker ranking,
of

`(Pr_better[competitor takes my top] - Pr_worse[competitor takes my top]) * valueGap`.

This isolates the economics: weaker competition is valuable when the stronger
competitor is more likely to collide with the second mover's top candidate.

/--
A sufficient monotonicity condition for weak competition to be weakly valuable.
If the better competitor collides at least as often with every relevant first
choice and all top-second gaps are nonnegative, then facing the worse competitor
weakly improves second-mover utility.
